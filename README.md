# Gridsome shopping cart example using Vuex with modules

An example Gridsome static site using Vue and Vuex with modules for shopping cart functionality.

The example site uses [Vuex shared mutations](https://github.com/xanf/vuex-shared-mutations) so that the shopping cart is syncronised across tabs. It also uses [Vuex persistedstate](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate) so that the basket is stored locally so if you revisit the site the shopping cart isn't lost.
